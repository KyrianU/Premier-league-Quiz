* For this project, I really wanted to embody the spirit of the Premier league by incorporating the color theme of the premier league. I used the light blue color for the body, the white for the box container, the light red and green colors for the buttons and the purple for the writing.

### Font used 

* The font family I used for this project is ["Montserrat", sans-serif;](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=Montserrat)
